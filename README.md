## **Model with Memory 🧠**

A simple implementation of a **LLM-based chatbot with memory**, using `ctransformers` to run **Mistral 7B** locally.

### **🚀 Features**
- **Local execution** using `ctransformers`
- **Memory support** to maintain context
- **Lightweight and efficient** implementation

---

## **🛠️ Installation**
### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Ensure you have `ctransformers` installed:
```bash
pip install ctransformers
```

### **2️⃣ Download the Model**
This script uses **Mistral 7B (GGUF format)**. Download it from:
🔗 [Mistral 7B GGUF](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF)  

Place the `.gguf` model file in the **`models/`** directory.

---

## **🖥️ Usage**
Run the chatbot with:
```bash
python main.py
```

It will start an interactive chat session, maintaining memory across responses.

---

## **⚙️ Configuration**
Modify the `main.py` file to:
- Change the **LLM model path**
- Adjust **context length**
- Customize **prompt behavior**

---

## **📜 Example Output**
```
User: What is the capital of South Korea?
AI: The capital of South Korea is Seoul.
User: And what is its population?
AI: The population of Seoul is approximately 9.7 million.
```
(The model remembers previous questions!)

## **📌 Notes**
- This implementation is optimized for **low-resource local inference**.
- It works with **GGUF models**, ensuring compatibility with `ctransformers`.
